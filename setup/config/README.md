Some details about the files in this folder:

- **config_ansible-demo.xml**: This is basically the **config.xml** file that would be generated when creating a job in Jenkins UI;
- **plugins.txt**: list of plugins to be installed (more precisely, in this case, pre-installed);
- **vault_pass.txt**: simple, clean text file with the Ansible Vault password that will be provided to the ansible playbook during the job execution.
